<p>Alice was a cryptographer, a person who studies codes and ciphers. She loved to decipher secret messages and create her own puzzles for others to solve. She worked for a government agency that dealt with national security and intelligence. Her job was to crack the codes of enemy spies and terrorists.</p>
<p>One day, she received a mysterious email from an unknown sender. It contained a long string of letters and numbers that looked like gibberish. Alice was intrigued by the challenge and decided to try to decode it. She used various tools and techniques, such as frequency analysis, substitution cipher, transposition cipher, and modular arithmetic. She spent hours trying different combinations and permutations, but nothing made sense.</p>
<p>She was about to give up when she noticed something odd. The email had a subject line that said “Hello Alice”. She wondered how the sender knew her name. She looked at the email address again and realized that it was an anagram of her own name: <a class="link" href="mailto:alice@ecila.com" >alice@ecila.com</a>.</p>
<p>She felt a chill down her spine. Who was this person and how did they know her? She typed a reply: “Who are you and what do you want?”</p>
<p>She waited for a few minutes, but there was no response. She checked the email header and traced the IP address of the sender. It led her to a website that had only one page: a picture of a smiling face with the words “Welcome to Wonderland”.</p>
<p>Alice felt a surge of curiosity and fear. She clicked on the picture and entered a new world of secrets and mysteries.</p>

<p>Jumper was a hacker who loved to crack codes and ciphers. He had a knack for finding patterns and solving puzzles. He was always looking for new challenges and secrets to uncover.</p>
<p>One day, he stumbled upon a website that claimed to offer the ultimate test of cryptograhpy skills. It was run by a mysterious proprirter who called himself Parser. The website had a series of levels, each with a different cipher to decrypt. The first level was easy: it was just a simple Caesar shift. Jumper solved it in seconds and moved on to the next level.</p>
<p>The second level was harder: it was a transposition cipher. Jumper had to rearrange the letters of the ciphertext according to a key that Parser had hidden somewhere on the website. Jumper searched every page and every link, but he couldn&rsquo;t find any clue. He decided to try brute force: he wrote a program that would try all possible permutations of the columns until he found one that made sense.</p>
<p>He ran his program and waited for the result. After a few minutes, his screen displayed:</p>
<p><code>CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE SOLVED THE SECOND LEVEL THE KEY WAS CODE</code></p>
<p>Jumper smiled and clicked on the link to proceed to the next level.</p>
<p>The third level was even harder: it was a gibberish cipher. Jumper had to replace each letter of the plaintext with a random string of characters that Parser had generated using some algorithm. Jumper looked at the ciphertext and felt dizzy:</p>
<p><code>!@#$%^&amp;*()_+QWERTYUIOP{}|ASDFGHJKL:&quot;ZXCVBNM&lt;&gt;?1234567890-=qwertyuiop[]\asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,./</code></p>
<p>He had no idea how to start cracking this one. He tried to look for patterns or repetitions, but he couldn&rsquo;t find any. He wondered if Parser had used some kind of hash function or encryption algorithm to create this gibberish.</p>
<p>He decided to do some research on gibberish ciphers online. He found out that they were also known as substitution-permutation ciphers, because they involved both substituting letters with other symbols and permuting them in some order. He learned about some common techniques for breaking them, such as frequency analysis, index of coincidence, Karnaugh maps and canocial forms.</p>
<p>He decided to try frequency analysis first: he counted how many times each symbol appeared in the ciphertext and compared it with the expected frequencies of letters in English text. He noticed that some symbols were more common than others, such as <code>!</code>, <code>Q</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>q</code>. He guessed that these might correspond to vowels or other frequent letters.</p>
<p>He then tried index of coincidence: he calculated how likely it was that two symbols chosen at random from the ciphertext would be identical, and compared it with the expected value for a random text. He found out that the index of coincidence was slightly higher than random, which meant that there was some order behind the gibberish.</p>
<p>He then tried Karnaugh maps: he grouped the symbols into four-bit binary codes and plotted them on a grid. He looked for adjacent cells that had similar codes and tried to simplify them using Boolean algebra. He hoped to find some patterns or rules that Parser had used to generate the gibberish.</p>
<p>He then tried canocial forms: he converted each symbol into a number based on its position in the ASCII table and applied some mathematical operations to them. He tried addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, exponentiation and logarithm. He looked for any patterns or regularities that would reveal some structure or logic behind the gibberish.</p>
<p>He spent hours trying these techniques, but he couldn&rsquo;t find any clue. He felt frustrated and hopeless. He wondered if Parser had used some kind of decoder that was impossible to reverse-engineer. He wondered if he had met his match.</p>
<p>He decided to take a break and check his email. He was surprised to see a message from Parser himself. It read:</p>
<p>Hello Jumper,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed by your skills and perseverance. You have solved two levels of my website, but you are stuck on the third one. I can see that you are trying hard, but you are missing something crucial.</p>
<p>The gibberish cipher is not just a substitution-permutation cipher. It is also a transposition cipher. You have to rearrange the symbols according to another key that I have hidden somewhere on the website.</p>
<p>If you can find this key and decrypt this level, you will be one step closer to solving my ultimate challenge: a cipher that combines all types of ciphers I have used so far.</p>
<p>Are you ready for this?</p>
<p>Good luck,</p>
<p>Parser</p>
